"],["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction This lecture module introduces several basic concepts when working with WDL Workflows. It highlights several considerations when using Docker container technology and provides an overview of the main sections in an example WDL workflow. These slides are adapted from the WDL 101 Workshop. More information can be found in this presentation hosted by Bioinformática UFMG. Learning Objectives Four parts of WDL Workflows on Terra How Docker improves reproducibility Overview of basic WDL syntax Find and configure Workflows You can view and download the Google Slides here. "],["run-workflow.html", "Chapter 2 Run Workflow", " Chapter 2 Run Workflow This tutorial demonstrates how to run a WDL Workflow on AnVIL. It uses the fun and accessible WDL puzzles workspace to run a “Hello, World!” style workflow. By showcasing how input parameters are specified and where output files can be found, this exercise helps provide context before writing your own WDL Workflow.
