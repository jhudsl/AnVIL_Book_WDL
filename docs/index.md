# Overview {-}

This book introduces WDL Workflows on AnVIL-powered-by-Terra.  After introducing several concepts, including basic WDL syntax, we present hands-on exercises to run a workflow, write a WDL, localize a file, customize a Docker image, and join the Discourse.  No local software installation is required as each exercise leverages web-based resources.
