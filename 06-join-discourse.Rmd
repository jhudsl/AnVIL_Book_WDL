Congratulations!  You've practiced running WDL Workflows on Terra-powered-by-AnVIL, importing and configuring publicly available WDL workflows, writing an introductory WDL using the web-based editor at Broad Methods Repository, calculating idxstats across multiple genomic data files, and customizing your own Docker image.

Please join the the conversation in the AnVIL Support Forums at https://help.anvilproject.org where you can ask any and all questions and we'll do our best to help!
